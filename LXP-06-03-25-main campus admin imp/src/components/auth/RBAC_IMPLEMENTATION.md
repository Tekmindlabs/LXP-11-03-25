# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system has been successfully implemented in the AIVY LXP application. This system provides a comprehensive solution for controlling access to features, pages, and UI elements based on user roles, permissions, and access scopes.

## Components Created

1. **AccessControl**: A component that conditionally renders content based on the user's role, access scope, and permissions.
2. **ProtectedRoute**: A component that protects routes based on authentication and authorization rules.
3. **PermissionIndicator**: A component that displays the user's role and access scope as a badge, tooltip, or text.
4. **RoleBasedNavigation**: A component that renders navigation items based on the user's role, access scope, and permissions.

## Features Implemented

1. **Role-Based UI Rendering**: Conditionally render UI elements based on user roles and permissions.
2. **Route Protection**: Protect routes that require authentication or specific roles.
3. **Permission-Based Access**: Control access to features based on user permissions.
4. **Access Scope Control**: Restrict access based on the user's access scope (single campus, multiple campuses, or all campuses).
5. **Role Visualization**: Display the user's role and access scope in the UI.
6. **Dynamic Navigation**: Show or hide navigation items based on the user's role and permissions.
7. **Nested Permissions**: Support for nested permission checks in navigation items and UI elements.
8. **Fallback Content**: Provide alternative content for users who don't have access to specific features.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. AccessControl Component

The `AccessControl` component uses a simple but powerful approach to conditionally render content:

```tsx
<AccessControl
  userType={userType}
  accessScope={accessScope}
  allowedUserTypes={['TEACHER', 'COORDINATOR']}
  requiredPermissions={['edit_course']}
  userPermissions={userPermissions}
  fallback={<p>You don't have permission to view this content</p>}
>
  <button>Edit Course</button>
</AccessControl>
```

The component checks if:
- The user's type is in the allowed user types (if specified)
- The user's access scope is in the allowed access scopes (if specified)
- The user has all the required permissions (if specified)

If all conditions are met, the children are rendered; otherwise, the fallback content is rendered.

### 2. ProtectedRoute Component

The `ProtectedRoute` component extends the concept of `AccessControl` to route protection:

```tsx
<ProtectedRoute
  isAuthenticated={isAuthenticated}
  userType={userType}
  accessScope={accessScope}
  allowedUserTypes={['SYSTEM_ADMIN', 'CAMPUS_ADMIN']}
  loginRedirect="/auth/login"
  unauthorizedRedirect="/dashboard"
>
  <AdminPage />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

The component:
- Checks if the user is authenticated
- Verifies if the user has the required role and permissions
- Redirects to the login page if not authenticated
- Redirects to an unauthorized page if not authorized
- Shows a loading indicator while checking authentication (optional)

### 3. PermissionIndicator Component

The `PermissionIndicator` component provides a visual representation of the user's role and access scope:

```tsx
<PermissionIndicator
  userType={userType}
  accessScope={accessScope}
  renderAs="badge"
/>
```

The component can render as:
- A badge with color coding based on the user's role
- A tooltip that shows the role and access scope on hover
- Plain text

### 4. RoleBasedNavigation Component

The `RoleBasedNavigation` component renders navigation items based on the user's role and permissions:

```tsx
<RoleBasedNavigation
  items={navigationItems}
  userType={userType}
  accessScope={accessScope}
  userPermissions={userPermissions}
  vertical={true}
  mobile={true}
  collapsible={true}
  isCollapsed={isNavCollapsed}
  onToggleCollapse={handleToggleCollapse}
  onToggleExpand={handleToggleExpand}
/>
```

The component:
- Filters navigation items based on the user's role and permissions
- Supports nested navigation items with their own permission checks
- Handles mobile navigation with collapsible menus
- Supports both vertical and horizontal navigation
- Provides extensive customization options through CSS classes

## Testing

Comprehensive test files have been created for each component:

1. **AccessControl.test.tsx**: Tests for conditional rendering based on roles and permissions.
2. **ProtectedRoute.test.tsx**: Tests for route protection and redirection.
3. **PermissionIndicator.test.tsx**: Tests for different rendering modes and styling.
4. **RoleBasedNavigation.test.tsx**: Tests for navigation item filtering and interaction.

The tests cover:
- Rendering with different user roles and permissions
- Conditional rendering of UI elements
- Route protection and redirection
- Navigation item filtering
- Mobile navigation and collapsible menus
- Custom styling and class names

## Documentation

Detailed documentation has been created for the RBAC system:

1. **RBAC_DOCUMENTATION.md**: Comprehensive documentation of the RBAC components, including usage examples, props, and best practices.
2. **RBAC_IMPLEMENTATION.md**: This implementation summary document.

## Example Page

An example page has been created to demonstrate the RBAC components in action:

- **src/app/rbac-example/page.tsx**: A page that showcases all RBAC components with interactive controls to change the user's role, access scope, and permissions.

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration**: Integrate the RBAC system with the backend authentication and authorization system.
2. **User Management**: Create a user management interface for administrators to assign roles and permissions.
3. **Permission Management**: Create a permission management interface for administrators to create and manage permissions.
4. **Audit Logging**: Implement audit logging for authorization-related events.
5. **Fine-Grained Permissions**: Extend the permission system to support more fine-grained permissions.
6. **Role Hierarchy**: Implement a role hierarchy system to simplify permission management.
7. **Dynamic Permissions**: Support for dynamically loading permissions from the backend.

## Conclusion

The Role-Based Access Control system provides a flexible and powerful way to control access to features, pages, and UI elements based on user roles, permissions, and access scopes. The components are well-documented, thoroughly tested, and ready for integration with the backend authentication and authorization system.

The RBAC system follows best practices for React development, including:
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Component-based architecture
- Separation of concerns
- Reusable and composable components
- Comprehensive testing
- Detailed documentation

The system is now ready for use in the AIVY LXP application and can be extended as needed to support additional requirements.
