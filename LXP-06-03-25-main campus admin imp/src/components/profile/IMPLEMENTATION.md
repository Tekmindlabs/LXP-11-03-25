# User Profile Management Implementation

## Overview

We have successfully implemented the User Profile Management feature for the AIVY LXP application. This feature allows users to view and edit their profile information, change their password, and upload a profile image.

## Components Created

1. **ProfileDisplay**: Displays user profile information including name, email, username, user type, phone number, date of birth, and profile image.

2. **ProfileEditForm**: Allows users to edit their profile information, including name, phone number, date of birth, and profile image.

3. **PasswordChangeForm**: Provides a form for users to change their password with validation for password complexity.

4. **ProfileImageUpload**: A reusable component for uploading and previewing profile images with drag-and-drop support.

## Pages Created

1. **Profile Page**: A page that integrates all the profile components and handles the state management between different views (display, edit, change password).

## Features Implemented

- **Profile Information Display**: Shows user details in a clean, organized layout.
- **Profile Editing**: Form with validation for updating user information.
- **Password Management**: Secure password changing with complexity requirements.
- **Profile Image Upload**: Support for uploading and previewing profile images.
- **Responsive Design**: All components are fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Accessibility**: Components follow accessibility best practices with proper labels and ARIA attributes.
- **Form Validation**: Zod schemas for client-side validation.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and handling for form submissions.

## Technical Implementation

- Used React Hook Form with Zod for form validation
- Implemented responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Created reusable components that can be used throughout the application
- Added proper TypeScript typing for all components and props
- Included fallbacks for null or missing data
- Prepared for integration with TRPC API endpoints

## Testing

Created test files for the components to ensure they function correctly:
- Tests for rendering user information
- Tests for handling user interactions
- Tests for form validation
- Tests for edge cases (null values, missing data)

## Documentation

- Created comprehensive README with usage examples
- Added detailed prop documentation for each component
- Included information about backend integration

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect the components to the actual TRPC API endpoints.
2. **Role-Based Field Visibility**: Implement conditional rendering based on user roles.
3. **Additional Profile Fields**: Add support for role-specific profile fields.
4. **Image Optimization**: Implement image cropping and resizing.
5. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Add support for setting up 2FA in the profile settings.

## Conclusion

The User Profile Management feature is now ready for integration with the backend. The components are reusable, well-documented, and follow best practices for React development.
