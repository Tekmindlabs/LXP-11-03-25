## Detailed Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Attendance Management System

**Objective**: Implement a comprehensive attendance management system for campus administrators to track and manage student attendance across classes.

**Background**:
The system already has an Attendance model and API endpoints in the attendance router, but these are not integrated into the campus admin portal UI. The attendance model tracks student attendance by class, date, and status (PRESENT, ABSENT, LATE, EXCUSED).

**Requirements**:

1. **Attendance Dashboard**
   - Create a new section in the campus admin portal for attendance management
   - Implement an overview dashboard showing attendance statistics by class
   - Display attendance trends over time with visual charts
   - Show attendance rates by program and class

2. **Attendance Recording Interface**
   - Create an interface for recording attendance for a class on a specific date
   - Allow bulk recording of attendance for multiple students
   - Support different attendance statuses (Present, Absent, Late, Excused)
   - Enable adding remarks for individual attendance records

3. **Attendance Reports**
   - Generate detailed attendance reports by class, date range, or student
   - Export attendance data to CSV/Excel format
   - Create visual representations of attendance patterns
   - Implement filters for viewing attendance by status, date, class, or program

4. **Attendance Notifications**
   - Set up automatic notifications for low attendance rates
   - Configure attendance threshold alerts
   - Send notifications to relevant stakeholders (teachers, coordinators)
   - Track chronic absenteeism

5. **Attendance Analytics**
   - Implement analytics to identify attendance patterns
   - Compare attendance across different classes and programs
   - Correlate attendance with academic performance
   - Generate insights for improving attendance rates

**Technical Implementation**:

1. **Frontend Components**:
   - Create `/src/app/admin/campus/attendance/page.tsx` for the main attendance page
   - Implement `/src/components/attendance/AttendanceRecorder.tsx` for recording attendance
   - Develop `/src/components/attendance/AttendanceReport.tsx` for generating reports
   - Build `/src/components/attendance/AttendanceStats.tsx` for displaying statistics

2. **API Integration**:
   - Utilize the existing attendance router endpoints
   - Implement additional endpoints if needed for analytics and reporting
   - Create client-side hooks for attendance data fetching and manipulation

3. **Database Interactions**:
   - Use the existing Attendance model
   - Implement efficient queries for attendance analytics
   - Ensure proper indexing for performance optimization

4. **UI/UX Design**:
   - Design intuitive interfaces for attendance recording
   - Create visually informative dashboards and reports
   - Implement responsive design for all attendance components

**Deliverables**:
- Complete attendance management section in the campus admin portal
- Attendance recording interface with bulk operations
- Comprehensive attendance reporting system
- Attendance analytics dashboard
- Documentation for the attendance management system

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

### Task 2: Timetable Management System

**Objective**: Implement a comprehensive timetable management system for campus administrators to create, manage, and visualize class schedules.

**Background**:
The system has Timetable, TimetablePeriod, SchedulePattern, and ScheduleException models, along with corresponding API endpoints, but these are not fully integrated into the campus admin portal UI. The timetable system needs to handle complex scheduling requirements including recurring patterns and exceptions.

2. **Schedule Pattern Management**
   - Interface for creating and managing schedule patterns
   - Support for different recurrence types (daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly)
   - Ability to specify days of the week and time ranges
   - Management of start and end dates for patterns

3. **Conflict Detection and Resolution**
   - Implement automatic detection of scheduling conflicts
   - Check for teacher availability conflicts
   - Verify facility availability
   - Provide suggestions for conflict resolution

4. **Schedule Exceptions Handling**
   - Create interface for managing exceptions to regular schedules
   - Support for holidays, special events, and one-time changes
   - Allow rescheduling of affected classes
   - Notification system for schedule changes

5. **Timetable Visualization**

2. **API Integration**:
   - Utilize existing schedule and schedule-pattern router endpoints
   - Implement additional endpoints for conflict detection and resolution
   - Create client-side hooks for timetable data fetching and manipulation

3. **Database Interactions**:
